# User Cases Post Guidelines

### Terminology

- #user-cases: The forum channel that holds all the user case posts.
- user case: A forum post in the #user-cases forum.
- user event: An action that was taken by a user of any nature (usually something that needs to be moderated) that is (going to be) logged in their user case.
- user id embed: The user id surounded by syntax that signals discord to render it as a clickable username embed. The syntax is `<@userid>` which would resolve to something like `<@123456789012345678>`.

### Description

This server handles its user moderation action logging on a case by case basis.
A case can be created inside a forum channel "#user-cases" for each user.
Each case will hold the entire history of users significant events and discussion about set user,
which then in turn functions as a way to communication this users events in this community to all other staff members.

## User Case Creation Rules

A new user case may only be created for a user if that user does not have a case yet.
If a user case already exists for that user, the new user event will be appended to this user case instead.

### User Case Title

The title must consist of the following in order seperated by spaces:
1. username (not the display name): This will allow the usercase to be searched by username
2. user id embed: This will allow the usercase to be searched by user id

### User Case Description

The initial post description must consist of the following in order seperated by newline feeds:
1. user embed id: This will allow any staff member to view the users profile while inside the usercase.
2. description of the user event that leads to the creation of this user case.
3. any relevant message links that did not naturally fit in the description body.

Any user event logged in this user case after the initial description only have to contain `2` and `3`.
